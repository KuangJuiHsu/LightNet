LightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as the Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). LightNet supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.

## How to use LightNet

Install the latest Matlab R2016a on a computer with an Nvidia GPU (at least 3GB GPU memory), and run the RunAll.m Matlab script.

Convolutions can be accelerated with CUDNN thanks to the work from the MatConvNet team.

## How to accelerate LightNet

CUDNN can be used to calculate convolutions.   
To enable that:  
1. Please go to http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/ to download and compile MatConvNet with the CUDNN support.  
2. Copy the folder 'MatConvNet_Dir/matlab/mex' into 'LightNet_Dir/CoreModules/mex'. You may need to copy some dynamic libraries in the CUDNN folder to the LightNet mex folder as well depending on your system.  
3. Set opts.use_cudnn=1 in the main tesing script.
